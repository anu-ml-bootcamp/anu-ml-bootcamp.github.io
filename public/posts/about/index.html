<p>Data science and machine learning are revolutionising our approach to research, identifying new insights and opening up new opportunities.
Joining the revolution can be difficult for even the most experienced scientist or specialist without a background in computing, so we are here to help.</p>
<p>In this pilot program two experienced ML/DS researchers from the <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/">ANU School of Computing</a> (SOCO) will join you for an assessment meeting.
There, you can outline your data, research question and/or desired machine learning and data science approach.</p>
<p><strong>We can then:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest appropriate data science methods</li>
<li>Recommend best practice approaches</li>
<li>Provide a workflow to guide implementation</li>
<li>Do a training needs analysis</li>
<li>Point you to appropriate resources</li>
</ul>
<p>After this session we will outline our suggestions and establish a plan for a set of support meetings which you can schedule as fits with your progress.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Bootcamp for?</strong><br>
Primarily research staff. We are happy to work with HDR students, but request that a supervisor attends the initial assessment meeting so we can get a comprehensive overview of the research.</p>
<p><strong>Questionnaire</strong><br>
To make this meeting effective, please try to complete <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=XHJ941yrJEaa5fBTPkhkNyCGn3VITfNIq8dJe2P694NURVlOM0FTTzVJMkxYWlNJSlNJRFRGMlVESy4u">this questionnaire</a>.
Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t have the answers! We will work through the questionnaire with you at your assessment meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Book a meeting</strong><br>
If you have any questions or would like to have an assessment meeting, please grab 60 minutes with us for an <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ANU7@ANU365.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/">appointment</a>.</p>
